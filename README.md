nbsearch
========

NBsearch is a tool for generating a simple list of search results from the [National Library of Norway's](http://www.nb.no/English) archive.

Go to [jekyll-hyde.no/nbsearch](http://jekyll-hyde.no/nbsearch) to try the service, or clone these files to your own server. 

NBsearch is skinned with [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). But nothing about the core functionality is dependent on it.

I made NBsearch as a way to generate a simple list of direct urls to PDFs from a search in [National Library of Norway's](http://www.nb.no/English) archive of digitized newspapers. This list can be copy-pasted to a text-file and run through [wget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget).	

NBsearch mostly a way for me to learn more about PHP, JSON, APIs and git. I welcome all forks and feedback, please be informative in commit messages.
