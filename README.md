nbsearch
========

NBsearch is a tool for generating a simple list of search results from the (Norwegian) National Library database.

NBsearch is also a way for me to learn more about PHP, JSON, APIs and git. I welcome all forks and feedback, please be informative in commit messages.

NBsearch is skinned with [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).
